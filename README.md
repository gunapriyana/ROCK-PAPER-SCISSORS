# ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS
This Python-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game integrates basic artificial intelligence to provide an engaging and interactive experience. 
The game allows users to play against a computer opponent for a specified number of chances, tracking wins for both the user and the Computer The goal is to offer a dynamic and entertainingenvironment where users can test their decision-making skills and strategic thinking against a digital adversary. 
Players will make their choices—Rock, Paper, or Scissors—while the computer responds with randomized moves. 
The game employs a simple set of rules to determine the winner of each round. 
Throughout the specified number of chances, a running tally of victories for both the user and the computer is maintained, culminating in an overall winner at the end of the game. 
The Rock, Paper, Scissors game serves as a fun and accessible introduction to basic artificial intelligence concepts, illustrating how algorithms can simulate decision-making processes.
Whether you emerge victorious or face defeat, the game offers an entertaining blend of chance and strategy, showcasing the potential of incorporating artificial intelligence into classic games for an enhanced user experience. As users progress through the 5 chances, the game serves as an accessible demonstration of how artificial intelligence principles can be applied to simulate decision processes. 
This project aims to demonstrate the blend of simplicity and sophistication achievable in AI applications, making it an enjoyable experience for users exploring the intersection of gaming and basic artificial intelligence.
